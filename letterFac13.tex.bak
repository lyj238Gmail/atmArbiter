Dear Editors:

Dear Editors:

We would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled ¡°Symbolic
Analysis of Round-Robin Arbitration in Networks¡±, which we wish to
be considered for publication in ¡°Transactions on Computer-Aided
Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems¡±. No conflict of interest
exits in the submission of this manuscript, and manuscript is
approved by all authors for publication.

Note that this article is a revised and extended version
of~\cite{ICCD2012} that appears in the proceedings of 2012 IEEE 30th
International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD). In this work, we
added the verification of response property. At last, we also
demonstrate how to generate interesting test patterns from STE
(GSTE) assertions. I would like to declare on behalf of my
co-authors that two thirds of  the work described was original
research that has not been published previously, and not under
consideration for publication elsewhere.

All the authors listed have approved the manuscript that is
enclosed. In this work, contents such as the verification of
response property of Round-Robin arbiters and generation of  test
patterns from STE (GSTE) assertions, are original. I hope this paper
is suitable for ¡°Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of
Integrated Circuits and Systems¡±.   We deeply appreciate your
consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving
comments from the reviewers. If you have any queries, please don¡¯t
hesitate to contact me at the address below.
